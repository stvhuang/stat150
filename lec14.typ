== Lecture 14

Last week we proved the main mc theorem for finite state space mc's:

#block[
  *Theorem.* $(X_n)$ an IRR, APER mc on state space $|S| < infinity$. Then

  1. There is a SD $pi$: $pi = pi P$ & $sum pi_j = 1$
  2. $lim_(n -> infinity) p_(i j)^n = pi_j$; for all $i, j$.
  3. $pi_j = lim_(n -> infinity) (N_n(j)) / n$ = LR prop. of steps in state $j$
  $= 1 / (E_j T_j)$ = inverse mean return time to $j$
]

To prove this, we proved several general results:

*Theorem 1.19* Suppose $(X_n)$ is IRR, aperiodic and has a SD $pi=pi P$. Then $lim_(n->infinity) p_(i j)^n = pi_j$ for all $i,j$

*Theorem 1.20* Suppose $(X_n)$ is IRR and REC. Then it has a stationary measure $mu >= 0$: $sum_i mu_i p_(i j) = mu_j$ for all $i$.

#pagebreak()

*Theorem 1.21* $(X_n)$ IRR & REC. Then
$ lim_(n->infinity) (N_n(j)) / n = 1 / (E_j T_j) $

*Theorem 1.22* If $(X_n)$ IRR & has SD $pi$ (i.e. $pi=pi P$ & $sum_i pi_i = 1$) then
$ pi_j = 1 / (E_j T_j) $

*Theorem 1.23* Suppose $(X_n)$ is IRR has SD $pi$, & $sum_x |f(x)| pi_x < infinity$. Then
$ 1/n sum_(m=1)^n f(X_m) -> sum_x f(x) pi_x $

Notice that some of the previous results can hold even when $|S| = infinity$.

== [D] ยง1.11: Infinite State Spaces

In this lecture we'll discuss the a generalized main mc theorem that can hold even when $|S|=infinity$.

- The main issue is recurrence when $|S|=infinity$. It is not enough *just* to be REC:

#pagebreak()

#block[
  *Def* Suppose $j$ is REC: $P_j(T_j < infinity) = 1$. Then we call $j$

  Positive Recurrent (Pos Rec) if $E_j T_j < infinity$

  Null Recurrent (Null Rec) if $E_j T_j = infinity$.
]

- Pos Rec: will return & mean wait time is finite.

- Null Rec: will return, but mean wait time is infinite.

- Boltzmann(1887) defined a state that is aperiodic & pos rec to be *ergodic*.

#block[
  *Def* We call a mc ergodic if all states are ergodic.
]

#pagebreak()

Facts:

1. Pos/null rec is a class property. Therefore, so is ergodicity.
2. If a communication class is finite & rec, then it is pos rec. Therefore for finite state space mc's Rec $==>$ Pos Rec.

  *Generalized Main MC Theorem.*

  $(X_n)$ an irreducible, ergodic mc. Then

  1. There is a SD $pi$: $pi = pi P$ & $sum pi_i = 1$
  2. $lim_(n -> infinity) p_(i j)^n = pi_j$; for all $i,j$.
  3. $pi_j = lim_(n -> infinity) (N_n(j)) / n$ = LR prop. of steps in state $j$
  $= 1 / (E_j T_j)$ = inverse mean return time to $j$

- We need pos rec so that we can normalize the stationary measure in theorem 1.20 above to get a stationary distribution: $pi = pi P$ and $sum pi_i = 1$.

What is SD $pi$? Does it exist?

#pagebreak()

This is a B&D mc (recall this means $p_(i j) = 0$ unless $j in {i, i+-1}$).
So to find SD, we try to solve DB equations.

Recall normalizing method:
1. Find $x_i p_(i j) = x_j p_(j i)$ (usually start by setting some $x_i=1$)
2. Then put $pi_i = x_i / (sum_j x_j)$.

This works provided $sum_j x_j < infinity$.

#pagebreak()

Set $x_0 = 1$.

$ x_0 p_(01) = x_1 p_(10) ==> p = x_1 q $
$ ==> x_1 = p/q $.

$ x_1 p_(12) = x_2 p_(21) ==> p/q dot p = x_2 q $
$ ==> x_2 = (p/q)^2 $

$dots.v$

$ x_j = (p/q)^j $

#pagebreak()

In order to normalize, we need $sum_j x_j = sum_(j=0)^infinity (p/q)^j < infinity$

If $p >= 1/2$ then $p/q >= 1$

$
  therefore sum_j x_j = cases(
    infinity "if " p >= 1/2,
    1 / (1 - p/q) "if " p < 1/2,
  )
$

#block[
  So for $p < 1/2$, $pi_i = (1 - p/q)(p/q)^i$
  $ = (1-2p)/(1-p) (p/q)^i $
]

#pagebreak()

$(X_n)$ is clearly irreducible.

$therefore$ For $p < 1/2$, $(X_n)$ IRR & has SD.

By Theorem 1.22 above,
$ E_j T_j = 1/pi_j = (q/p)^j (1-p)/(1-2p) < infinity $

#block[
  $therefore$ For $p < 1/2$ all states are pos rec.

$therefore$ For $p < 1/2$, $(X_n)$ IRR & has SD.

By theorem 1.22 above,
$ E_j T_j = 1 / pi_j = (q/p)^j (1-p)/(1-2p) < infinity $

What happens for $p >= 1/2$?

- In this case, rw is getting pull away from the reflecting boundary. It seems that rw can drift off to $infinity$ and not have an equilibrium, at least when $p > 1/2$. $p=1/2$ seems less clear.
