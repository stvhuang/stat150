== Lecture 13

Next, we aim to prove part (2.) of the main MC theorem. This follows by:

== Theorem 1.21
If $(X_n)$ is irreducible and recurrent, then
$
  lim_(n -> oo) (N_n(j)) / n = 1 / (E_j T_j)
$

And

== Theorem 1.22
If $(X_n)$ is irreducible and has a stationary distribution $pi$ (i.e., $pi = pi P$ and $sum_i pi_i = 1$), then
$
  pi_j = 1 / (E_j T_j)
$

Therefore, if $(X_n)$ is irreducible, aperiodic, and $|S| < oo$, we know $(X_n)$ is recurrent and so a stationary distribution $pi$ exists. So,
$
  lim_(n -> oo) (N_n(j)) / n = 1 / (E_j T_j) = pi_j
$

- Also note that Theorem 1.22 implies that if $(X_n)$ is irreducible and has a stationary distribution $pi$, then the stationary distribution is *unique*.
(i.e., if $pi' = pi' P$, then $pi' = pi$)
- If an irreducible MC has an equilibrium, it is *unique*!

Note that Theorem 1.21 does not require aperiodicity.

Eg. $0 <-> 1$
$
  P = mat(
    0, 1;
    1, 0;
  )
$

Irreducible, recurrent and has a stationary distribution, although period = 2. $pi = (1/2, 1/2)$ (Doubly stochastic.)

$1/2 = E_1 T_1 =$ long-run proportion of time spent in state 1.

#pagebreak()

First, we note that Thm 1.21 $arrow$ Thm 1.22:

== Proof of Thm 1.22
Suppose $(X_n)$ is irreducible and has a stationary distribution $pi$.

By a previous lemma, if there is a stationary distribution $pi$, then all $i$ with $pi_i > 0$ are recurrent. Therefore, since $(X_n)$ is irreducible, all states are recurrent (recurrence is a class property). Hence, by Thm 1.21,
$
  lim_(n -> oo) (N_n(j)) / n = 1 / (E_j T_j)
$

#pagebreak()

This holds no matter what $X_0$ is.

Assuming $X_0 ~ pi$, and taking expectations on both sides,
$
  E_pi[(N_n(j)) / n] -> 1 / (E_j T_j) quad "as" quad n -> oo
$

But since $pi$ is a stationary distribution,
$
  E_pi[N_n(j)] = sum_(m=1)^n overbrace(P_pi(X_m = j), "= " pi_j) = n pi_j
$

Therefore,
$
  1 / (E_j T_j) = pi_j
$
#square

Finally,

== Proof of Thm 1.21
Suppose $(X_n)$ is irreducible & recurrent. We show
$
  (N_n(j)) / n -> 1 / (E_j T_j)
$
(no matter what $X_0$ is).

First, if $X_0 = j$, then the times $t_1, t_2, ...$ between visits to $j$ are iid.

#pagebreak()

Let $T_k = min { n >= 1 : N_n(j) = k }$
$= "time of " k^"th" " return."$
$= sum_(l=1)^k t_l$

By LLN,
$
  T_k / k -> E_j T_j quad "as" quad k -> oo
$
since $T_k$ = sum of k iid rvs with mean $E_j T_j$.

#pagebreak()

If $X_0 != j$, it doesn't make a difference in the limit:
$t_1 < oo$ since $(X_n)$ is irreducible & recurrent.
Then $t_2, t_3, ...$ are iid with mean $E_j T_j$.

Therefore, no matter what $X_0$ is,
$ lim_(k -> oo) T_k / k = E_j T_j $ (TODO)

#pagebreak()

To finish the proof, note
$
  T_(N_n(j)) <= n < T_(N_n(j) + 1)
$

- $N_n(j)$ = \# visits by time $n$.
- $T_(N_n(j)) = n$ if $X_n=j$, or else $T_(N_n(j)) < n$.
- At time $n$, have visited $N_n(j)$ times. So $n <$ time of $(N_n(j)+1)^"th"$ visit $= T_(N_n(j)+1)$.

#pagebreak()

$
  N_2(j) = 1
$
$
  underbrace(T_1, 2) <= 2 < underbrace(T_2, 4)
$

$
  N_6(j) = 3
$
$
  underbrace(T_3, 5) <= 6 < underbrace(T_4, 8)
$

#pagebreak()

Hence,
$
  underbrace((T_(N_n(j))) / (N_n(j)), "-> " E_j T_j) <= n / (N_n(j)) <= (T_(N_n(j)+1)) / (N_n(j))
$
$
  = underbrace((T_(N_n(j)+1)) / (N_n(j)+1), "-> " E_j T_j) underbrace(((N_n(j)+1)) / (N_n(j)), "-> 1")
$

Since $j$ is recurrent, $N_n(j) -> oo$ as $n -> oo$. (Will visit $oo$ many times.)

Therefore,
$
  lim_(n->oo) n / (N_n(j)) = E_j T_j
$ #square

#pagebreak()

The following generalization is proved in Durrett:

== Theorem 1.23
Suppose $(X_n)$ is irreducible, has a stationary distribution $pi$, & $sum_x |f(x)| pi_x < oo$. Then
$
  1/n sum_(m=1)^n f(X_m) -> sum_x f(x) pi_x
$

Taking $f(x) = bb(1)_(x=j)$, we recover
$
  (N_n(j)) / n -> pi_j quad "as" quad n -> oo.
$

See ยง1.5 for some applications of Theorem 1.23.

== Eg Repair chain

Working as long as $>= 2$ parts working.
Otherwise, parts are replaced, then machine working next day.

Q: Operate system for 5 years ($tilde 1,800$ days).
About how many parts 1,2,3 will we use?

A: Can show
$
  pi = 1/8910 (underbrace(3000)_0, underbrace(500)_1, underbrace(1200)_2, underbrace(4000)_3, underbrace(22)_12, underbrace(60)_13, underbrace(128)_23)
$

#pagebreak()

Therefore, over 1800 days, will use about
$
  1800 (pi_12 + pi_13) = 1800 * 82/8910 approx 16.5
$
parts of type 1.

- Here we are using Thm 1.23 where

$ f_x = bb(1)_(x in {12, 13}) $.
